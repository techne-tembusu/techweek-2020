            <h3>A peculiar week of tech talks and <br/>workshops at Tembusu College.</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 100px;">The theme for the first iteration of TechWeek is Navigating the New Normal. As we are on the road of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to reflect on the unprecedented living and working conditions arising out of the outbreak, and how we have individually and collectively been navigating through it. Undeniably, technology plays an integral role in facilitating the transition to the new normal. While we all embrace what technology has to offer, we shall also take moments to enquire critically into how it has been used, what its implications are, how it has impacted our lives physically and mentally.</p>
